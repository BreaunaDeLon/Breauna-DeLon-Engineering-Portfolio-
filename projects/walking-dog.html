    <h2>Mechanical Systems & Kinematic Analysis Project</h2>

    <p>
      Team-based reverse engineering project focused on analyzing and reproducing
      a consumer toy’s internal walking mechanism through CAD modeling,
      motion analysis, and mechanical decomposition.

<!-- ================= PROJECT OVERVIEW ================= -->
<section>
  <h3>Project Overview</h3>

  <p>
    This project involved reverse engineering a commercially available walking dog toy
    to understand how simple mechanical components can be combined to produce
    coordinated, repeatable motion.
  </p>

  <p>
    The internal mechanism was disassembled, measured, and reconstructed in CAD
    to model linkages, gear trains, and motion paths responsible for the toy’s walking behavior.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= MECHANICAL ANALYSIS ================= -->
<section>
  <h3>Mechanical & Kinematic Analysis</h3>

  <p>
    The walking motion was achieved through a motor-driven gear train connected to
    a multi-link leg mechanism. Rotational input from the motor was converted into
    oscillatory leg motion using offset linkages and pinned joints.
  </p>

  <p>
    Special attention was given to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Gear ratios and torque transmission</li>
    <li>Linkage lengths and joint constraints</li>
    <li>Synchronization between front and rear legs</li>
    <li>Stability during ground contact phases</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- ================= TEAM & LEADERSHIP ================= -->
<section>
  <h3>Team Role & Leadership</h3>

  <p>
    Served as team lead, coordinating task assignments, timelines, and design reviews.
    Responsibilities included delegating CAD modeling tasks, verifying dimensional accuracy,
    and ensuring consistent assembly constraints across the full model.
  </p>

  <p>
    This role emphasized leadership, communication, and accountability while balancing
    technical problem-solving with team coordination.
