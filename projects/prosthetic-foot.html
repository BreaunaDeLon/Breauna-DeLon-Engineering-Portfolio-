<!-- ================= PROJECT OVERVIEW ================= -->
<section>
  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This project focused on the design and structural evaluation of a low-cost prosthetic
    foot intended to withstand typical walking load cases while remaining manufacturable
    and accessible. The goal was to evaluate material performance and geometry using
    finite element analysis to inform design decisions.
  </p>
</section>

  
<!-- ================= Design and Methodology ================= -->
<section>
  <h2>Design and Methodology</h2>

  <p>
    This project focused on designing a low-cost, energy-storing prosthetic foot using
    SolidWorks CAD and Finite Element Analysis (FEA). The goal was to balance durability,
    flexibility, and affordability while maintaining safe performance under real-world
    loading conditions.
  </p>

  <p>
    A static force of 980 N was applied at the hinge location to represent body weight
    transfer during standing and walking. Multiple load cases were evaluated to simulate
    upward motion (toe-off), downward motion (heel strike), and static standing.
  </p>
</section>
<!-- ================= Upward Walking Motion ================= -->
  <section>
  <h2>FEA Results – Upward Walking Motion</h2>

  <p>
    This simulation represents toe-off during walking, where the prosthetic foot flexes
    upward under load. The results show controlled bending behavior with stress and strain
    remaining within the elastic limits of the carbon fiber foot blade.
  </p>

<!-- ================= Downward Walking Motion ================= -->
  <section>
  <h2>FEA Results – Downward Walking Motion</h2>

  <p>
    This case simulates stepping downward, representing a worst-case bending scenario.
    Higher stress and displacement values were observed, but all remained below material
    failure limits, validating the structural integrity of the design.

</section>

<!-- ================= Standing Load Case ================= -->
<section>
  <h2>FEA Results – Standing Load Case</h2>

  <p>
    The standing simulation represents static body weight applied to the prosthetic foot.
    Minimal stress, strain, and displacement were observed, confirming that the design can
    safely support everyday standing loads.

<!-- ================= ENGINEERING ANALYSIS ================= 
<section>
  <h2>Engineering Focus & Analysis</h2>
  <p>
    Finite element simulations were used to evaluate stress distribution and deformation
    across the prosthetic foot under applied loading representative of walking conditions.
    Material selection was guided by strength-to-weight ratio, manufacturability, and
    accessibility considerations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Results from the analysis informed geometric modifications aimed at improving
    structural performance while maintaining simplicity and cost-effectiveness.
